# KIC-Launcher
An all-in-one launcher to boot Larian KIC games

Why does KIC Launcher exist?
--------------------
KIC Launcher was made to provide a user friendly GUI to launch Larian KIC games, while offering extra features, such as a resolution modifier.

Is the launcher the same for all versions?
--------------------
Yes. All KIC games are mostly the same, so the launcher does not change.
To trigger a brand change, change the value of "KICLauncher.cfg" to either (case sensitive)
